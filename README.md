# SolART
SolART is a web application created by our team - 'The Hackletes' - for the [NASA 2022 Space Apps Hackathon](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/creative-data-display/teams/the-hackletes/project). This app  turns solar weather data from NASA into synth tones and moving artwork.   
  
By feeding real-time data from NASA into an AI artwork generator ([Lucid Sonic Dreams](https://github.com/mikaelalafriz/lucid-sonic-dreams)), SolART aims to create beautiful visualizations that change in response to proton flux caused by solar activity. SolART further aims to sonificates the data by representing solar activity as pitch.
