# SolART
SolART is a web application that turns solar weather data from NASA into synth tones and moving artwork. By feeding real-time data into an AI artwork generator (Lucid Sonic Dreams), SolART creates beautiful visualizations that change in response to proton flux caused by solar activity. SolART further sonificates the data by representing solar activity as pitch.
